# TicTacToe

This game runs in the terminal.

To play, simply select whether you want to be "X" or "O" when prompted. 
Then, input the coordinates of your move with 1 1 being the top left corner and 3 3 being the bottom right.

You will play against an AI opponent, which uses a minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to make decisions.
As far as I can tell its unbeatable, but give it a shot.

All code is written solely by me from the ground up and may be reused as seen fit.

(I have no idea why the readme looks like this in preview, please view in raw format for best results)

This game runs in the terminal.

To play, simply select whether you want to be "X" or "O" when prompted. 
Then, input the coordinates of your move based on the follwoing grid:

1 1 | 1 2 | 1 3
---------------
2 1 | 2 2 | 2 3
---------------
3 1 | 3 2 | 3 3


Example:

   |   |   
-----------
   |   |   
-----------
   |   |   

Enter your move (row# column#): 2 2

   |   |   
-----------
   | X |   
-----------
   |   |   



You will play against an AI opponent, which uses a minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to make decisions.
As far as I can tell its unbeatable, but give it a shot.
